# Robotics Camp Objectives
## Objectives of RoboPro Ⅰ
### General Icon Programming Environment Information 
* It’s the practice of **creating your own programs using goal directed icons to piece together specific functions the user wants to carry out**, like spinning a robot or telling it to move a certain direction. It also breaks down the functions of each icon that is used in the software. 
* In the link below, on pages **19-23**, a guide shows all of the uses of the icons.
* https://www.artec-kk.co.jp/studuino/docs/en/Studuino_manual.pdf
* **Will incorporate this information into the beginning of the first day of the workshop to give the ninjas a basic understanding of what icon programming is and how it works**.

### Day 1 of Workshop Objectives (ServoWalker, Block Thrower)
* This teaches the student the **functions of a servo motor**, and how its used if some of the robot is moving while the other part stays stationary. It pursues the idea of a “ServoWalker”, which highlights the uses of a servo motor.
* After the user/student gets a basic understanding of a servo motor and its uses, the curriculum moves into the **importance of sensors**.
* The project (block thrower) utilizes a light sensor, and the purpose of this is to get the thrower to determine if the block its given is dark enough to throw, which the student will eventually code into the thrower.
* After the project, the curriculum throws in some activities that **test the students knowledge about what they learned so far with sensors and motors** by making a block toss and accuracy test. It challenges them to see which student or team of students can throw the furthest block with the best accuracy.

### Day 2 of Workshop Objectives (Collision Detection Robot, Double Dolphins)
* The goal for this day is for the student to learn **how a robot detects/ avoids collisions**. 
* The first project is a collision car that detects an object is in front of it and the car makes a decision on if it should move out of the way of the collision or not. 
* The curriculum adds an activity to **show if the students know how the detection works** by giving them the task of making the robot move from one corner of the room to the other without any collisions.
* The Double Dolphins activity sums up what the students have learned so far into a final robot project that **consists of the functions of a servomotor**, by making a scene where the dolphins are moving back and forth in place on the motor as a scene rests in front of them also on the motor.

### Day 3 of Workshop Objectives (Coding Concepts, Line Tracer, Light Tower)
* The students will get an **explanation of what the following terms are and how they work in block code, like scratch** to be able to complete the upcoming projects:

      - Conditionals (if/then)
      - Functions
      - Loops
      
* **It's important that they understand these concepts because they are used in the rest of the upcoming projects**.
* The line tracer project will teach the students **how sensors work and function**.
* It's also important that the students **understand what DC motors are and how they operate, along with photoreflectors**.
* Also allows them to understand how if the sensor senses a value lower than a destined value, then the line tracing robot does a certain task.
* The light tower project will teach the students about the same concepts of the line tracer, except now when the sensors detect that a value is lower than, higher than, or equal to a destined value using those conditionals, then it activates a LED and a song function all while in a forever loop.
* The light tower project also incorporates the use of a **touch sensor**, so the students will need to have a brief understanding of what that is too.

### Day 4 of Workshop Objectives (Turn Robot, Transporter)
* The students will **incorporate more functions, conditionals, and loops** into the turn robot project.
* The new concepts the students will inquire **consist of using an "and" operator as a conditional statement to call certain functions**.
* The transporter project uses the same concepts of **functions, conditionals, and loops**.
* **BACKUP PROJECT**
      
      Doggy Robot
      - uses the concepts of functions, conditionals, and loops
      - A little harder than the previos to challenge the ninjas that finished earlier and to test their skills they have obtained so far.

### Day 5 of Workshop Objectives (Building/Programming a Quadrupedal Walkbot, Building a Bipedal Robot)
* The students will build and program a Quadrupedal Walkbot.
* The project consists of the same concepts as the previous projects, but **brings in the function called "ServoMotor Synchro Motion Speeds Function"**.
* It's important the students understand what that function is used for and why they are using it.
* The Bipedal Robot is more complicated in that it contains more pieces and code, which is why **on day 5 the students are only building the bipedal robot and not coding it**.
* **BACKUP PROJECT**
      
      Sensor Meolody Robot
      - uses condtionals like sensors and if/then
      - uses oops and functions as well 
      - more challenging than the others so far to challenge the ninjas that finished earlier and to test their skills they have obtained.


### Day 6 of Workshop Objectives (Programming the bipedal Robot, Improving the Bipedal Robot into a Dinobot)
* The Bipedal Robot project brings in **new concepts like center of gravity and motor calibration**.
* It also **brings in variables(speed)**, but other than that, still uses the same concepts and functions of the previos projects.
* The dinobot consists of adding a new function called "tail", but it still uses the bipedal robot and all of its code.
* **This is the final day of the workshop**.
