# Collison Detecting Robot Project 
## Introduction
> ### Collision Detecting Robot
> Your catapult was pretty cool right? well now we'll build a robot that can actually move around by itself and detect when it's going toward an object! 

---

> ### What Will I Learn?
> This project will teach you how to program your robot to detect collisions. For example, if there is an object in front of your robot while it's moving, it will move around it!
> One thing to note is now we are bringing in a different motor called a **DC Motor**. Some DC Motors are used in automobiles and trains to deliver high amounts of power like in electric trains and cars to make them go forward and backward!

---

> ### The Main Purpose Of Building This Robot
> On the Servo Walker project we taught you how to program a robot to move in a crawling manner, and in the Block Thrower project we detected if there is a block to be thrown. In this project, we will combine those projects into a single robot that can move by itself!
