# Turn Robot Project
## Introduction
> ### Turn Robot
> This project is all about touch! This robot will back up and move away from the direction that it was pressed from, using 1 or 2 sensors!

---

> ### What Will I Learn?
> You will learn how to call functions depending on if a conditional that you program is met. The functions will turn the robot in a different direction and move it that new direction.

---

> ### The Main Purpose of Building This Robot:
> To understand how a robot can sense that it is being touched and to make it do something when it is touched.
