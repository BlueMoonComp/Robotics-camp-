# Servo Walker Project 
## Introduction
> #### Servo Walker 
> Now you are ready to start building your very own robots. However, you have to crawl before you walk. Speaking of walking, have you ever seen a walking robot? Well, that is what we are going to create for today's lesson.

---

> #### What Will I Learn?
> This lesson will teach you how to create a simple moving, but stationary robot using only one servomotor and a minimum amount of parts.

---

> #### The Main Purpose Of Building This Robot:
> As you continue to build more robots in this camp, you will learn how building stationary robots prepars you to build robots that move by directed actions or self-programming.
