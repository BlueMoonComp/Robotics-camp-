# Double Dolphins Project
## Introduction
> ### Double Dolphins
> Congradulations on making it this far! So far the robots we built have been very practical, well now you'll get to built a work of moving art! 

---

> ### What Will I Learn?
> For this final lesson, it will be more artsy than useful. We will build an animatronic robot of two dolphins that are swimming in the sea.

---

> ### The Main Purpose of Building This Robot:
> The main purpose is to create a robot using all the tools and knowledge that you have obtained so far in these projects.
