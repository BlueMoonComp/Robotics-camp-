# Light Tower Project
## Introduction
> ### Light Tower
> The last few robots you made could move and detect things, well now we're going to make a robot that doesn't move, but still detects or reacts to something. The light tower you are going to build can be turned on by the sound of someone clapping! Not only can it do that, but if you touch the actual touch sensor, then the tower will light up and start making sounds!

---

> ### What Will I Learn?
> In this project you will learn how touch and sound sensors can detect when sound or touch happens.

---

> ### The Main Purpose of Building This Robot:
> The main purpose is for the student to understand what a light tower is and how to make one function by detecting certain events that happen around it.

## Activity 1
### Building The Light Tower
### What You Need To Build:
> * Studuino Unit
> * Battery Box
> * LED (red, green, blue, and white)
> * Buzzer
> * Light Sensor
> * Sound Sensor
> * Touch Sensor
> * 8 Basic Cubes
> * 4 Clear Basic Cubes
> * 3 Half B blocks
> * 29 Half C blocks
> * 4 Half D blocks
> * 1 USB cable
> * 8 Sensor connecting cables
> ### Note that the colors of the blocks don't really matter, just make sure you have the right amount of what ever color block you choose.

### 1
The first thing we are going to do is to add the battery box to the studuino unit.

### 5 
One of the last things we need to do is to build the top of the tower.

### 6 
Now, we just have to put the parts together. At the end of your steps, your light tower should look like the last picture.
