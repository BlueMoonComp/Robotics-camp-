# Transporter Project
## Introduction
> ### Transporter
> The turn robot was a fun project huh? Well, now we're going to make a robot that can follow a line! I like to compare this project to a self driving car, because both of these machines use guidelines to determine where it wants to go next!

---

> ### What Will I Learn?
> This project will teach you how to make your transporter robot travel on a certain path while carrying and transporting a single object or more than one!

--- 

> ### The Main Purpose Of Building This Robot:
> We are going to take what we have learned from the collision detecting robot and upgrade it to where instead of detecting collision, it will detect a line path to move on. To activate the robot to do so, we will have the robot carry and transport small objects.
